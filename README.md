# Inventory Management System

## Project Overview
The Inventory Management System is designed to streamline and automate the inventory tracking process for a medium-sized retail company. This system leverages a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability on AWS.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot
- **Cloud Services:** AWS Lambda, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudWatch
- **DevOps Tools:** Jenkins, Docker
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau

## Architecture
The system is built using microservices, with each service responsible for specific functionalities such as inventory management, order processing, and reporting. Services are deployed on AWS using Docker containers and orchestrated using AWS Lambda and EC2.

## Features
- **Backend Development:** Implemented using Java and Spring Boot with a microservices architecture.
- **API Integration:** Developed REST APIs for inventory management, order processing, and reporting. Integrated with AWS services like API Gateway for secure API management.
- **CI/CD:** Implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins for automated testing and deployment. Docker was used for containerization.
- **Data Visualization:** Integrated Tableau to generate real-time inventory reports and visualizations for stakeholders.

## Responsibilities
- **Backend Development:** Designed and implemented the backend using Java and Spring Boot, leveraging microservices architecture on AWS.
- **API Integration:** Developed REST APIs and integrated with AWS services for secure and efficient API management.
- **CI/CD:** Set up and managed CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, automated testing, and deployment processes.
- **Containerization:** Utilized Docker for containerizing services and deployed them on AWS Lambda and EC2.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Integrated AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging to ensure system reliability and performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Used Tableau to create insightful reports and visualizations, providing real-time data insights to stakeholders.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Analytics:** Planning to add predictive analytics capabilities for inventory forecasting using AWS Redshift.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Exploring additional monitoring solutions to provide more granular insights into system performance.
